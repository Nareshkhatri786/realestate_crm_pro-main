#### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/realestate_crm_pro-main.git
   cd realestate_crm_pro-main

#### Coding Standards

##### Code Style
- Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent formatting
- Follow React best practices and hooks guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write self-documenting code with clear comments when necessary

##### Component Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use proper prop validation
- Follow the established folder structure
- Create reusable components in `/src/components/ui/`

##### State Management
- Use Context API for global state (auth, notifications)
- Use local state for component-specific data
- Consider Redux Toolkit for complex state management needs

##### API Integration
- Use the existing API service layer in `/src/api/`
- Handle loading and error states consistently
- Follow the established error handling patterns
- Add appropriate request/response logging

##### Styling
- Use TailwindCSS utility classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain consistency with the existing design system
- Avoid inline styles unless absolutely necessary

##### Testing
- Write unit tests for new components and functions
- Include integration tests for complex features
- Maintain or improve existing test coverage
- Test across different browsers and screen sizes

#### Making Changes

##### Branch Naming
- `feature/` - New features
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Testing improvements

##### Commit Messages
Follow the conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
